## Project scope

The impact of developing a neural network-based solution for autonomous path following for robots is significant, as it can contribute to the development of more advanced and efficient autonomous robots for a variety of applications such as autonomous cars, drones, warehouse material handling robots, etc. Deep Learning techniques provides better learning opportunities for the robot to perform a task as compared to traditional hard coding. This project will drive us to learn new material related to deep learning and computer vision, as well as reinforce our knowledge of robotics and ROS. This project will encourage learning in topics such as systems integration, data collection, data preprocessing, machine learning model design, performance evaluation, which are essential skills for a end-to-end robotics projects with Neural Network application. It will also provide an opportunity to explore different neural network architectures and their applications in robotics. Overall, this project will help me develop a more comprehensive understanding and hands-on experience systems integration and machine learning applications in robotics.
